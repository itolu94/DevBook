# JrDevBook

This is our Second Project for our class at The Coding Bootcamp at UNC-Chapel Hill.

It is a full stack web application using Node and Express, we used MySQL for our database and Sequelize for our ORM.  

We incorporated mutliple new packages in order to do this, including Passport and Bcrypt.
